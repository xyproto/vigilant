# Vigilant

Vigilant is a utility that can be used to monitor changes in a source file in one repo and then create pull requests in another.

## Building

```bash
go build -mod=vendor
```

## Configuring

Edit `config.toml` to select which repo to monitor and which repo to create pull requests in.

Get a private GitHub token and then set the GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable, for example:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="asdfasdf" # your GitHub token with rights to read public data and create pull requests goes here
```

## Running

```bash
./vigilant
```

## Triggering a pull request manually

```bash
pkill -USR1 vigilant
```

## Extra notes

* When a new pull request is made, the `since` field in `config.toml` is also updated.
* The Vigilant server checks for changes every 10 minutes.
